cglm Documentation
================================

**cglm** is an optimized 3D math library written in C99 (compatible with C89).
It is similar to the original **glm** library, except **cglm** is mainly for
**C**.

**cglm** stores matrices as column-major order but in the future row-major is
considered to be supported as optional.
