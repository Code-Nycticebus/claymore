ðŸ“š API documentation
================================

**cglm** provides a few APIs for similar functions.

* ðŸ“¦ **Inline API**: All functions are inline. You can include **cglm/cglm.h** header
  to use this API. This is the default API. `glm_` is namespace/prefix for this API. 
* ðŸ“¦ **Call API**: All functions are not inline. You need to build *cglm* and link it
  to your project. You can include **cglm/call.h** header to use this API. `glmc_` is namespace/prefix for this API. 

And also there are also sub categories:

* ðŸ“¦ **Array API**: Types are raw arrays and functions takes array as argument. You can include **cglm/cglm.h** header
  to use this API. This is the default API. `glm_` is namespace/prefix for this API. 
* ðŸ“¦ **Struct API**: Types are union/struct and functions takes struct as argument and return structs if needed. You can include **cglm/struct.h** header
  to use this API. This also includes **cglm/cglm.h** header.`glms_` is namespace/prefix for this API but your can omit or change it, see struct api docs.
* ðŸ“¦ **SIMD API**: SIMD functions and helpers. `glmm_` is namespace/prefix for this API. 

ðŸ“Œ Since struct api and call api are built top of inline array api, follow inline array api docs for individual functions.
